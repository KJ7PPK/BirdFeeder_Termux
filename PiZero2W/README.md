# The OG - Pi Zero / 2 W RTSP Streaming & Health Monitor Script
**Note:** The audio quality I got from USB mics, USB sound cards with analog lav mics, and analog lav mics with a separate ADC is marginal at best - the amount of noise the hardware introduces is significant, even compared to the low bitrate, low sample-rate audio I get from my POE surveillance cameras.

This script turns a Pi into an appliance for feeding audio to an RTSP server (MediaMTX in my case) for consumption by BirdNET-Go. I found that the actual capture and stream function leaves plenty of headroom even on a Zero 2W, so since BirdNET-Go can really only tell me if the RTSP stream is up or down, I implemented a simple busybox function to publish a "health" overview page on port 8080. Eventually, I plan to migrate away from the static page generation and publish to MQTT or otherwise integrate into Home Assistant for monitoring the node(s).

# My setup:
1. Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
2. Micro-to-A USB adapter.
3. $1 USB sound card
4. $3 omnidirectional lav microphone.
5. Standard Pi power supply.
6. 3D printed case.
7. MediaMTX running on a separate server alongside BirdNET-Go in Docker on OpenMediaVault.
   
# Functionality
- Captures audio from a USB sound card, encodes in AAC and publishes to an RTSP destination with FFMPEG.
- Optional: applies gain to audio before encoding.
- Optional: generates a static html system health page served on port 8080.

# SETUP BASICS FOR PI ZERO W
1. Put birdfeeder-audio.service in /etc/systemd/system/
2. Put birdfeeder-audio.service in /usr/local/bin/

# AUDIO CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
1. DEVICE: USB mic / sound card hardware ID (find via via arecord -l, mine tends to be 0,0)
2. RATE: Audio capture frequency (set to 48khz as that's my sound card's native)
3. BITRATE: Streaming bitrate, 128k seems to work just fine but this can be dropped down as needed, or increased with higher quality audio input.
4. URL: RTSP publishing path
5. THREAD_QUEUE_SIZE: Prevents loss of audio from spotty connections, good results at 4096.
6. GAIN_DB: Birdnet will normalize levels in clips, but live audio was low. I constantly used gain in the UI. Applying 15db gain worked for me.
7. LIMITER_LEVEL: This is just to prevent clipping, but realistically if this is utilized a lot, gain is too high.

# HEALTH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
1. STATUS_ENABLE: 1 turns on this functionality, 0 disables it.
2. STATUS_DIR: This is where we're writing the health information to periodically.
3. STATUS_INTERVAL: This is how frequently we're updating the health data file.

# TROUBLESHOOTING BASICS
1. Basically any adjustments you make to the .sh, just reboot the Pi instead of restarting the service.
2. systemctl status birdfeeder-audio.service should tell you what's going on if there are any errors.
